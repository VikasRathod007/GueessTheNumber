# GuessTheNumber Project

This small project, developed for my Sem 6 ISA, allows the user to input a number between 1-100. Depending on the user input, a positive or negative GIF will appear. The project utilizes React and the concept of Hooks to manage and update the state of the GIFs.

## How to Run:

1. Download the project folder.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the downloaded folder directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the project.

Now, you're all set to experience the GuessTheNumber project!
